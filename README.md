## Description

My application use auth with credentials and Google, we have created the Login Page and Sign Up page, to have the users registration to have the control of the medicines in your house, to do this you have to create a house or join one. This because you can organice your medicines with the people in your house and have more control on those, when you create a house your kit is empty and you can add more medicines with a simple button, when you want to join to an existing house you will have to tell one the member of the existing house that share a simple QR code with you and you use the button "Unirse a una casa" to open your camera then scan this code to join.

Then you have a house you can add new medicines to it and all the members house can see it and edit, and delete with a simple dismissable, the forms in my applications have validation because we need a especific information to help to improve your organization. The add medicine form you have to give us: Name, dose, units, amount, due date and active compounds.

This app will have a side menu with all the setting and information that you need to organize the better way your medicines and kits in your house
